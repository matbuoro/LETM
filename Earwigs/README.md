Genetic architecture of conditional strategies
====================================

This folder contains the datasets (.RData or .csv)  and the R scripts to run the analysis for the 'half-sib common environment' (named 'ISLANDS') and a 'family level split environment' (named 'EXPERIMENTS') experiments.

Note that we use the population codes :  
 * BR: North Sea islands of Brownsman  
 * WWO: West Wideopen  
 * EWO: East Wideopen
