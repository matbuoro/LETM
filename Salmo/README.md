Assessing adaptive phenotypic plasticity by means of conditional strategies from empirical data: the latent environmental threshold model  
===============


Here, we evaluated the performance of the LETM with a simulation study and illustrate its utility by applying it to empirical data on the size-dependent smolting process for stream-dwelling Atlantic salmon juveniles.
